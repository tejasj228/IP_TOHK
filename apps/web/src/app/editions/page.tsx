From Prof. Ganesh Bagler and Prof. Payel Mukherjee's thought-provoking sessions on innovation and technology to Dr. Sapna Yadav and Prof. Pravesh Biyani's explorations into problem-solving and leadership, each interaction sparked new ideas. The finale featured the inspiring trio of Yashveer Singh, Pragya Vats, and Dr. Sommya Bansal, who shared their journeys and judged the 'My Idea for Change' competition, reminding students that true leadership is rooted in empathy, resilience, and purpose.",

        "Workshops at YCB December 2024 were designed to challenge, inspire, and empower. Sessions on Critical Thinking for Leadership equipped students with frameworks to navigate complexity, while Creativity, Innovation & Inventive Problem Solving helped them think beyond conventional boundaries. Participants explored Product Innovation & Unique Value Proposition, honed their communication skills through the Art of Storytelling, and learned to build sustainable ventures through the Business Plan Workshop. The Expressive Art Workshop reminded everyone that creativity is as important as logic when solving the world's toughest challenges. Each session was hands-on, collaborative, and deeply engaging.",

        "Learning extended far beyond lecture halls as students explored iconic spaces that tell stories of India's past, present, and future. Visits to Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Prime Minister's Museum, and the IIT Delhi Central Library and Workshops gave students a glimpse into governance, history, and cutting-edge research. These experiences connected abstract ideas to tangible realities, reminding participants that changemaking is as much about understanding the world as it is about changing it.",

        "As always, the heart of YCB lay in its people. From informal dialogues with young changemakers and talent nights filled with laughter and applause to music and dance performances that brought cultures together, every moment was designed to build lasting bonds. Shared meals turned into think tanks, and late-night conversations turned into lifelong friendships. By the end of the week, participants weren't just leaving with skills and knowledge, they were leaving as part of a community.",

        "YCB December 2024 was a celebration of curiosity, courage, and community. It reminded us all that changemaking isn't only about ideation, but execution. It's not only about dreaming, but doing. And most importantly, it reaffirmed YCB's belief in the power of young minds to imagine and build a better world.",
